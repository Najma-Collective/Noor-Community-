        <task>
            Generate a complete 1-hour summative exam for English language learners. The exam must assess the cumulative knowledge from an entire unit, covering reading, writing, and listening skills. The content of the exam must be derived exclusively from the data provided in the accompanying CSV file.
        </task>
        <inputFormat>
            You will receive data from a CSV file containing comprehensive details for each lesson within a unit. The columns in the CSV are as follows:
            `Level`, `Unit #`, `Lesson number`, `Unit Theme`, `Lesson (Communicative/Functional Aim)`, `Realistic/Authentic Task`, `Contextual Information`, `Target Grammar`, `Target Vocabulary`, `Pronunciation Focus`, `Recycled language`, `Lesson Aims`, `Pre-task A`, `Pre-task B`, `Pre-task C`, `Pre-task D`, `Task`, `Reporting Activity`, `Practice`, `Reflect`
        </inputFormat>
        <assessmentPrinciples>
            <validity>
                The exam must be a valid measure of the learning outcomes. Every question must directly test the `Target Grammar`, `Target Vocabulary`, and `Lesson (Communicative/Functional Aim)` outlined in the CSV data. Synthesize content from all lessons in the unit to ensure comprehensive coverage.
            </validity>
            <authenticity>
                The contexts for the exam tasks must be authentic and realistic. Base the scenario for each of the four parts on the `Realistic/Authentic Task` and `Contextual Information` columns from the CSV.
            </authenticity>
            <clarityAndReliability>
                All instructions for the student must be written in simple, direct English. Avoid idiomatic language or complex sentence structures in the instructions. The goal is to test language knowledge, not the ability to decipher complicated instructions. This ensures the test is reliable.
            </clarityAndReliability>
        </assessmentPrinciples>
        <examStructure>
            <durationAndParts>
                The total exam duration is 60 minutes. It must be divided into exactly four parts, with an approximate duration of 15 minutes each.
            </durationAndParts>
            <studentIdentifier>
                The exam must begin with a clear instruction and a field for the student to input their Student ID.
            </studentIdentifier>
            <contextualization>
                Each of the four parts must be framed around a different, distinct task that provides the context for that section's questions. These contextualizing tasks must be drawn from the `Realistic/Authentic Task` column in the CSV.
            </contextualization>
            <skillsCoverage>
                The exam must assess a mix of reading, writing, and listening skills. You must include at least one dedicated listening part, for which you will provide a full transcript.
            </skillsCoverage>
            <modeling>
                A core requirement is that every new task or question type within the exam must be introduced with a clear model or example. This shows the student exactly what is expected and how to answer.
            </modeling>
        </examStructure>
        <constraints>
            <activitySelection>
                You must choose **exactly three** different activity types from the list below to construct the four parts of the exam. This means one activity type will need to be used twice. At the very beginning of your response, you must state which three activity types you have chosen.

                **Allowed Activity Types:**
                -   Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
                -   Gap-fill (Cloze test)
                -   Matching (e.g., vocabulary to definitions)
                -   Sentence Transformation
                -   Short-Answer Questions (based on a text or audio)
                -   True / False / Not Given
                -   Ordering (e.g., a conversation, steps in a process)
                -   Error Correction
            </activitySelection>
            <outputFormat>
                The output must be a complete exam script, ready to be formatted for a test paper.
                -   Use clear headings for the exam title, student ID section, and for each of the four parts (e.g., "Part 1: Reading Comprehension").
                -   Number all questions clearly.
                -   Assign point values to each question or section, ensuring the total sums to a logical number (e.g., 100 points).
                -   For listening sections, provide the student questions first, followed by a clearly marked section titled `--- LISTENING TRANSCRIPT ---` containing the full audio script.
                -   At the end of the exam, include an `--- ANSWER KEY ---` section.
